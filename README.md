Evolution
=========
A project created by awesomelemonade. First versions created in 2012 (Not uploaded to github). First commit in this version dates back to 2015. This project is a playground for experimenting with various features I have learned throughout my experience with programming.

Notable Highlights
------------------
* Reflection: Dynamic loading of classes via Java's reflection and annotations
* Handmade event system using Java reflection
* Signed Distance Field Font Rendering: Implemented a technique shown in this [paper](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf)
* OpenGL 3+ Rendering (Vertex Arrays, Vertex Buffers, Shaders, Shader Programs, GLSL, Uniform Variables, etc)
* Object model loading (ObjLoader) using .obj files for 3D rendering
* TimeSync using lwjgl's implementation of sync() to sync frame rates
* Experimentation with multithreading (splitting of update vs render)
* Cubemap rendering technique for skyboxes
* Terrain generation using perlin noise shown here: https://web.archive.org/web/20160325134143/http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/models/m_perlin.htm
* Raytracing with Moller Trumbore Intersection algorithm
* Handmade Linear Algebra library (Matrix, Vector)
* Handmade 3D Physics Library (Collision Detection/Response System)
* Window & Input Handling with GLFW + LWJGL
* Animations using Bezier Curves + Interpolations
* Cantor & Szudzik Pairing function implementations
* MurMur hash implementation
